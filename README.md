Mutational antigenic profiling of Perth/2009 H3 HA with monoclonal antibodies

This work was performed and analyzed by Juhye Lee. This project is in collaboration with Seth Zost and Scott Hensley.

### Organization

This repository is divided into analysis subdirectories:

* [`DMS_analysis`](./DMS_analysis/): contains analysis & comparison of mutant libraries generated by the helper-virus approach and the reverse-genetics approach
* [`MAP_analysis`](./MAP_analysis/): contains analysis of monoclonal antibody selections of the Perth/2009 H3 mutant virus libraries
